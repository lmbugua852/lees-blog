I had this - you might say - crazy thought. What if we did away with representative democracy?

What if we embrace the idea of direct democracy?

I think the standard of living of a lot of people would improve. A lot of malinivestements would be eliminated and
a lot of people would be able to live in a much more sustainable way.

That would mean the adoption of a new constitution. One that's' guided by sound praxeology and economic
principles.

Contrasted with the current constitution, the new constitution would be;

Devoid of an income tax.

Would not proceed to establish a central bank.

In short, the powers of the state would be neatly circumscribed.
