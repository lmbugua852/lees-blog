One need not pay too great heed to acrimonious colleagues who set him down as a word weaving trimmer,
between whose utterances and thoughts there is no organic nexus, who declines to take the initiative unless he sees
adequate forces behind him ready to render their support, who lacks the moral courage that serves as a prachute
for a fall from public grace, but pocessese in abudance that of taking at the flood the rising tide which balloon
like lifts its posessor high above his conteporaries.
